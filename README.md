# Proof of Concept: Systems Programming with Vulkan

## Overview

This project is a proof of concept aimed at learning systems programming and Vulkan with a minimalist approach. The goal is to "live off the land," coding everything from scratch without relying on external libraries or frameworks. This approach removes the friction of using the latest C++ standards and CMake best practices, allowing for a deeper understanding of the core concepts and low-level programming.

## Project Goals

- **Learn Systems Programming**: Dive deep into low-level programming, focusing on direct interactions with the operating system and hardware.
- **Vulkan Exploration**: Gain hands-on experience with Vulkan, the modern, high-performance graphics API.
- **Self-Reliance**: Avoid using any external libraries unless absolutely necessary, such as interfacing with GPU or sound hardware.
- **Minimalism**: Delay the adoption of advanced C++ features and CMake configurations to focus on foundational skills.

## Exceptions

While the primary goal is to code everything from scratch, there are a few exceptions:
- **Hardware Interfacing**: Libraries may be used for interfacing with hardware components like GPUs and sound devices, as these are complex and require specialized interactions.

## Future Plans

Once the foundational goals are achieved, the project will gradually incorporate modern C++ practices, CMake best practices, and possibly external libraries to build on the initial work.
