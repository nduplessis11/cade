# Proof of Concept: Cross-platform 2D/3D Vulkan Renderer

## Overview

This project is a proof of concept 2D/3D renderer implementation in Vulkan. The goal is to "live off the land," coding everything from scratch without relying on external libraries or frameworks. There are expceptions to low level interfaces to audio/video/io devices as these are complex and vendor specific.

## Goal

I'm going to start with a simple 2D arcade-style space shooter in the vein of Truxton, Gradius, and R-Type etc.
