# Proof of Concept: Cross-platform 2D/3D Vulkan Renderer

## Overview

This project is a proof of concept 2D/3D renderer implementation in Vulkan. The goal is to "live off the land," coding everything from scratch without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

## Project Goals

- **Systems Programming**: Dive deep into low-level programming, focusing on direct interactions with the operating system and hardware.
- **Vulkan Exploration**: Gain hands-on experience with Vulkan, the modern, high-performance graphics API.
- **Self-Reliance**: Avoid using any external libraries unless absolutely necessary, such as interfacing with GPU or sound hardware.
- **Minimalism**: No standard library or advanced C++ features, just plain old C.

## Exceptions

While the primary goal is to code everything from scratch, there are a few exceptions:
- **Hardware Interfacing**: Libraries may be used for interfacing with hardware components like GPUs and sound devices, as these are complex and require specialized interactions.
